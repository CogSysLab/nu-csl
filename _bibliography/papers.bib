  abstract={Radar Automated Target Recognition (RATR) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) involves transmitting Electromagnetic Waves (EMWs) and performing target type recognition on the received radar echo, which has important applications in defense and aerospace. Previous work has demonstrated the benefits of employing multistatic radar configurations in RATR compared to monostatic radar configurations. However, multistatic radar configurations commonly use fusion methods which combine the classification vectors of multiple individual radars suboptimally from a probabilistic perspective.
     To address this issue, this work leverages Bayesian analysis to provide a fully Bayesian RATR framework for UAV type classification. Specifically, we employ an Optimal Bayesian Fusion (OBF) method, from the Bayesian perspective of expected 0-1 loss, to formulate a posterior distribution that aggregates the classification probability vectors from multiple individual radar observations at a given time step. This OBF method is used to update a separate Recursive Bayesian Classification (RBC) posterior distribution on the target UAV type. The RBC posterior is conditioned on all historical observations made from multiple radars across multiple time steps.
    To evaluate the proposed approach, we simulate random walk trajectories for seven drones and correspond the target’s aspect angles to Radar Cross Section (RCS) measurements acquired in an anechoic chamber. We then compare the performance of single radar Automated Target Recognition (ATR) system and suboptimal fusion methods against the OBF method. We empirically show that the OBF method, integrated with RBC, significantly outperforms other fusion methods and single radar configuration in terms of classification accuracy.

      abstract={Continuously optimizing sensor placement is essential for precise target localization in various military and civilian applications. While information theory has shown promise in optimizing sensor placement, many studies oversimplify sensor measurement models or neglect dynamic constraints of mobile sensors. To address these challenges, we employ a range measurement model that incorporates radar parameters and radar-target distance, coupled with Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control to manage complex environmental obstacles and dynamic constraints. We compare the proposed approach against stationary radars or simplified range measurement models based on the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) estimator for the targets' state. Additionally, we visualize the evolving geometry of radars and targets over time, highlighting areas of highest measurement information gain, demonstrating the strengths of the approach. The proposed strategy outperforms stationary radars and simplified range measurement models in target localization, achieving a 38-74% reduction in mean RMSE and a 33-79% reduction in the upper tail of the 90% Highest Density Interval (HDI) over 500 Monte Carl (MC) trials across all time steps.

  abstract={Survival Analysis (SA) models the time until an event occurs, with applications in fields like medicine, defense, finance, and aerospace. Recent research indicates that Neural Networks (NNs) can effectively capture complex data patterns in SA, whereas simple generalized linear models often fall short in this regard. However, dataset uncertainties (e.g., noisy measurements, human error) can degrade NN model performance. To address this, we leverage advances in NN verification to develop training objectives for robust, fully-parametric SA models. Specifically, we propose an adversarially robust loss function based on a Min-Max optimization problem. We employ CROWN-Interval Bound Propagation (CROWN-IBP) to tackle the computational challenges inherent in solving this Min-Max problem. Evaluated over 10 SurvSet datasets, our method, Survival Analysis with Adversarial Regularization (SAWAR), consistently outperforms baseline adversarial training methods and state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep SA models across various covariate perturbations with respect to Negative Log Likelihood (NegLL), Integrated Brier Score (IBS), and Concordance Index (CI) metrics. Thus, we demonstrate that adversarial robustness enhances SA predictive performance and calibration, mitigating data uncertainty and improving generalization across diverse datasets by up to 150% compared to baselines.},

  abstract={Curvature estimation methods are important as they capture salient features for various applications in image processing, especially within medical domains where tortuosity of vascular structures is of significant interest. Existing methods based on centerline or skeleton curvature fail to capture curvature gradients across a rotating tubular structure. This paper presents a Tubular Curvature Filter method that locally calculates the acceleration of bundles of curves that traverse along the tubular object parallel to the centerline. This is achieved by examining the directional rate of change in the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix of a tubular intensity function in space. This method implicitly calculates the local tubular curvature without the need to explicitly segment the tubular object. Experimental results demonstrate that the Tubular Curvature Filter method provides accurate estimates of local curvature at any point inside tubular structures.},

  abstract={A late post-traumatic seizure (LPTS), a consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI), can potentially evolve into a lifelong condition known as post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). Presently, the mechanism that triggers epileptogenesis in TBI patients remains elusive, inspiring the epilepsy community to devise ways to predict which TBI patients will develop PTE and to identify potential biomarkers. In response to this need, our study collected comprehensive, longitudinal multimodal data from 48 TBI patients across multiple participating institutions. A supervised binary classification task was created, contrasting data from LPTS patients with those without LPTS. To accommodate missing modalities in some subjects, we took a two-pronged approach. Firstly, we extended a graphical model-based Bayesian estimator to directly classify subjects with incomplete modality. Secondly, we explored conventional imputation techniques. The imputed multimodal information was then combined, following several fusion and dimensionality reduction techniques found in the literature, and subsequently fitted to a kernel- or a tree-based classifier. For this fusion, we proposed two new algorithms: recursive elimination of correlated components (RECC) that filters information based on the correlation between the already selected features, and information decomposition and selective fusion (IDSF), which effectively recombines information from decomposed multimodal features. Our cross-validation findings showed that the proposed IDSF algorithm delivers superior performance based on the area under the curve (AUC) score. Ultimately, after rigorous statistical comparisons and interpretable machine learning examination using Shapley values of the most frequently selected features, we recommend the two following magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities as potential biomarkers: the left anterior limb of internal capsule in diffusion MRI (dMRI), and the right middle temporal gyrus in functional MRI (fMRI).},

    abstract={Recent advances in the theory of Neural Operators (NOs) have enabled fast and
accurate computation of the solutions to complex systems described by partial
differential equations (PDEs). Despite their great success, current NO-based solutions face important challenges when dealing with spatio-temporal PDEs over
long time scales. Specifically, the current theory of NOs does not present a systematic framework to perform data assimilation and efficiently correct the evolution of PDE solutions over time based on sparsely sampled noisy measurements.
In this paper, we propose a learning-based state-space approach to compute the
solution operators to infinite-dimensional semilinear PDEs. Exploiting the structure of semilinear PDEs and the theory of nonlinear observers in function spaces,
we develop a flexible recursive method that allows for both prediction and data
assimilation by combining prediction and correction operations. The proposed
framework is capable of producing fast and accurate predictions over long time
horizons, dealing with irregularly sampled noisy measurements to correct the solution, and benefits from the decoupling between the spatial and temporal dynamics of this class of PDEs. We show through experiments on the KuramotoSivashinsky, Navier-Stokes and Korteweg-de Vries equations that the proposed
model is robust to noise and can leverage arbitrary amounts of measurements to
correct its prediction over a long time horizon with little computational overhead.},

OBJECTIVE To investigate whether changes in peripheral physiology recorded by a wearable
biosensor and machine learning can be used to predict imminent aggressive behavior before it occurs
in inpatient youths with autism.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This noninterventional prognostic study used data
collected from March 2019 to March 2020 from 4 primary care psychiatric inpatient hospitals.
Enrolled participants were 86 psychiatric inpatients with confirmed diagnoses of autism exhibiting
operationally defined self-injurious behavior, emotion dysregulation, or aggression toward others; 16
individuals were not included (18.6%) because they would not wear the biosensor (8 individuals) or
were discharged before an observation could be made (8 individuals). Data were analyzed from
March 2020 through October 2023.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Research staff performed live behavioral coding of aggressive
behavior while inpatient study participants wore a commercially available biosensor that recorded
peripheral physiological signals (cardiovascular activity, electrodermal activity, and motion). Logistic
regression, support vector machines, neural networks, and domain adaptation were used to analyze
time-series features extracted from biosensor data. Area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) values were used to evaluate the performance of population- and persondependent models.},

These methods are extensively used for data-exploration tasks in various areas of Natural Sciences. However, most of these methods fail to handle confounding attributes in the dataset. For datasets where a data sample represent multiple attributes, naively applying any clustering approach can result in undesired output. To this end, we propose a novel framework for jointly removing confounding attributes while learning to cluster data points in individual subspaces. Assuming we have label information about these confounding attributes, we regularize the clustering method by adversarially learning to minimize the mutual information between the data representation and the confounding attribute labels. Our experimental result on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract={Error related potentials (ErrP), which are elicited in the EEG in response to a perceived error, have been used for error correction and adaption in the event related potential (ERP)-based brain computer interfaces designed for typing. In these typing interfaces, ERP evidence is collected in response to a sequence of stimuli presented usually in the visual form and the intended user stimulus is probabilistically inferred (stimulus with highest probability) and presented to the user as the decision. If the inferred stimulus is incorrect, ErrP is expected to be elicited in the EEG. Early approaches to use ErrP in the design of typing interfaces attempt to make hard decisions on the perceived error such that the perceived error is corrected and either the sequence of stimuli are repeated to obtain further ERP evidence, or without further repetition the stimulus with the second highest probability is presented to the user as the decision of the system. Moreover, none of the existing approaches use a language model to increase the performance of typing. In this work, unlike the existing approaches, we study the potential benefits of fusing feedback related potentials (FRP), a form of ErrP, with ERP and context information (language model, LM) in a Bayesian fashion to detect the user intent. We present experimental results based on data from 12 healthy participants using RSVP Keyboard™ to complete a copy-phrase-task. Three paradigms are compared: [P1] uses only ERP/LM Bayesian fusion; [P2] each RSVP sequence is appended with the top candidate in the alphabet according to posterior after ERP evidence fusion; corresponding FRP is then incorporated; and [P3] the top candidate is shown as a prospect to generate FRP evidence only if its posterior exceeds a threshold. Analyses indicate that ERP/LM/FRP evidence fusion during decision making yields significant speed-accuracy benefits for the user.},

EEG data were collected from 12 participants who completed BCI Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) calibrations at two different presentation rates: 1 and 4 Hz. Attention-related changes in posterior alpha activity were compared to two event-related potentials (ERPs): N200 and P300. Machine learning approaches evaluated target/non-target classification accuracy using alpha activity. Results indicated significant alpha attenuation following target letters at both 1 and 4 Hz presentation rates, though this effect was significantly reduced in the 4 Hz condition. Target-related alpha attenuation was not correlated with coincident N200 or P300 target effects. Classification using posterior alpha activity was above chance and benefitted from individualized tuning procedures. These findings suggest that target-related posterior alpha attenuation is detectable in a BCI RSVP calibration and that this signal could be leveraged in machine learning algorithms used for RSVP or comparable attention-based BCI paradigms.},

enabling expressive human-computer interaction at high accuracy, while minimizing the
time required for new subjects to provide calibration data. To fulfill these goals, we define
combination gestures consisting of a direction component and a modifier component. New
subjects only demonstrate the single component gestures and we seek to extrapolate from
these to all possible single or combination gestures. We extrapolate to unseen combination
gestures by combining the feature vectors of real single gestures to produce synthetic training
data. This strategy allows us to provide a large and flexible gesture vocabulary, while not
requiring new subjects to demonstrate combinatorially many example gestures. We pre-train
an encoder and a combination operator using self-supervision, so that we can produce useful
synthetic training data for unseen test subjects. To evaluate the proposed method, we collect
and release a real-world EMG dataset, and measure the effect of augmented supervision
against two baselines: a partially-supervised model trained with only single gesture data
from the unseen subject, and a fully-supervised model trained with real single and real
combination gesture data from the unseen subject. We find that the proposed method
