    I am a PhD candidate, working on developing machine learning algorithms for brain (EEG) and muscle signals (EMG). My main research interests are: self-supervised learning with EEG & EMG, real-time gesture recognition and multi-label classification, multimodal sensory fusion for Brain-Computer Interfaces. I also love playing guitar and piano!
