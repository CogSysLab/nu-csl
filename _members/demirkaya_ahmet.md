  My research focuses on developing hybrid modeling frameworks that merge physics-based methods with neural networks to explore complex dynamic systems, particularly those with partially observed states. Additionally, I am applying machine learning to time series data for forecasting applications, such as utilizing wearable biosensing technology to predict aggressive behavior in autistic youth.
