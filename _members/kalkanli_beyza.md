  During my PhD, I focus on improving active learning algorithms and training procedures, applying my knowledge to diverse domains such as eye disease detection and Brain-Computer Interface calibration.  I love traveling, playing volleyball, and I am unnecessarily competitive with games.
  Fun fact: In Australia, I went to a koala sanctuary and petted baby kangaroos.
