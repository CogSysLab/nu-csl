I am a researcher with expertise in physics and machine learning. My professional goal is to apply methods based on statistical inference and probabilities to guide solutions for real-life applications in physics, engineering, and medicine. I strongly value soft skills and can convey complex technical concepts to non-experts. I believe in the power of collaboration between interdisciplinary teams and am interested in partnering with industry affiliates to apply cutting edge research to address problems with social, medical, and economic ramifications.
